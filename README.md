# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Analysis-

This project aims to Developed a customer segmentation model using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to categorize consumer behavior
and for better marketing strategies.

Here my approach is to build a K-Means Clustering model to segment the customer base into Gold, Silver, and Platinum tiers, identifying high-value customers
and moderate-to-low engagement groups.
I aim to generate data-driven insights by calculating total RFM scores and performing frequency analysis on ”big spenders” to improve
retention and sales forecasting.
